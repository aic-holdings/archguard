# About Symmetra

Symmetra is a conversational guidance capture system that enables developers to capture architectural patterns directly from their codebase through natural conversation with Claude Code. The core innovation is the ability to say "This error handling pattern is clean - let's add it as guidance!" and have it instantly searchable for future use.

Built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, Symmetra integrates seamlessly with Claude Code and any MCP-compatible AI assistant to provide conversational pattern capture, semantic search, and comprehensive code analysis in real-time.
