# About ArchGuard

ArchGuard is an extensible AI-powered toolkit that helps development teams define, verify, and maintain their software architecture through real-time guidance and automated analysis. Unlike traditional linters that focus on syntax, ArchGuard provides semantic architectural guidance that understands your codebase's structure, patterns, and design decisions.

Built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, ArchGuard integrates seamlessly with Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant to provide L7-level architectural guidance in real-time.
