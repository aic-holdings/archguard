# ArchGuard Architectural Rules and Guidelines

## Security Best Practices
- Use established authentication libraries (OAuth, JWT)
- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use HTTPS everywhere

## Database Design
- Use connection pooling for performance
- Implement proper indexing strategy
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Plan for schema migrations
- Consider read replicas for scale

## API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use API versioning
- Add request/response validation
- Consider rate limiting

## Performance
- Profile before optimizing
- Implement appropriate caching
- Use database query optimization
- Consider async processing
- Implement pagination for large datasets

## Architecture
- Follow SOLID principles
- Separate concerns into focused modules
- Use dependency injection
- Consider microservices vs monolith trade-offs
- Document architectural decisions
