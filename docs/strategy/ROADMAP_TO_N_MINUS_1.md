# Symmetra Development Roadmap

## Purpose

This roadmap focuses on the practical steps needed to complete Symmetra and get it working in production with Claude Code. No enterprise planning - just development tasks.

---

## Phase 1: Fix Tests & Core Functionality (Current Priority)

### Week 1-2: Test Suite Repair
**Immediate Actions:**
- [ ] Run the test suite and identify the 24/129 failing tests
- [ ] Fix SecurityDetector test failures 
- [ ] Fix SizeDetector and PatternDetector test issues
- [ ] Ensure all MCP server tests pass
- [ ] Validate integration tests work correctly

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** 129/129 tests passing

### Week 3: uvx Installation Validation
**Actions:**
- [ ] Test uvx installation process end-to-end
- [ ] Verify MCP server starts correctly via uvx
- [ ] Test Claude Code integration with installed Symmetra
- [ ] Fix any installation or startup issues

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** Smooth uvx installation and Claude Code integration

---

## Phase 2: Production Readiness (Weeks 4-6)

### Core Functionality Completion
**Actions:**
- [ ] Enhance detection accuracy and coverage
- [ ] Improve architectural guidance quality
- [ ] Add error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Optimize performance for real-time use
- [ ] Test on various real codebases

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** Symmetra provides helpful, reliable guidance

### Documentation & Setup
**Actions:**
- [ ] Create simple setup guide for Claude Code users
- [ ] Document common configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Test installation on macOS, Linux, and Windows

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** Easy setup and clear documentation

---

## Phase 3: Enhancement & Optimization (Weeks 7-12)

### Coverage Expansion
**Actions:**
- [ ] Add more architectural patterns and guidance rules
- [ ] Expand programming language support
- [ ] Improve context awareness
- [ ] Add more detection capabilities

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** Broader coverage of architectural scenarios

### Quality Improvements
**Actions:**
- [ ] Enhance guidance quality based on usage feedback
- [ ] Improve performance and reliability
- [ ] Add monitoring and observability
- [ ] Implement configuration options for different project types

**Owner:** Claude Code  
**Success Criteria:** High-quality, reliable architectural guidance

## Current Status

**Week 1 Focus:** Fix the failing tests and ensure test suite reliability

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Run pytest to identify specific failing tests
2. Fix detection system test failures
3. Ensure MCP integration tests pass
4. Validate uvx installation workflow

**Key Principle:** Keep it simple. Focus on making Symmetra work well with Claude Code, not on enterprise features or market validation.
