# ArchGuard Deployment Strategy: Getting Team-Specific Guidance Into Production

## The Deployment Philosophy

ArchGuard's deployment strategy centers on getting teams real value quickly while building toward a more sophisticated system over time. Instead of waiting for a perfect solution, we deploy a working system that provides immediate benefits and evolves based on actual usage patterns. The goal is to have teams using ArchGuard for their daily architectural decisions within weeks, not months.

This approach recognizes that architectural guidance systems succeed or fail based on adoption, not technical sophistication. A simple system that teams actually use is infinitely more valuable than a complex system that sits unused. The deployment strategy prioritizes user feedback and iterative improvement over feature completeness.

## Infrastructure Foundation

The Supabase infrastructure we've built provides a production-ready foundation that can scale with usage. The PostgreSQL database with pgvector handles both relational data and vector search efficiently. The row-level security policies ensure proper access control without requiring complex application logic. The edge functions capability provides a pathway for more sophisticated API logic as needs evolve.

This infrastructure choice means we're not building a deployment from scratch. Supabase handles database management, scaling, backups, and security patching. Our deployment work focuses on application logic rather than infrastructure management. This significantly reduces the operational overhead and allows faster iteration on the features that matter to users.

## Initial Deployment Configuration

The first production deployment uses the existing bootstrap rules to provide immediate value while teams learn how to create their own specific guidance. This creates a working system that teams can evaluate and provide feedback on, rather than asking them to imagine how a future system might work.

The MCP server configuration for Claude Code uses the uvx execution pattern we've already tested. This means teams can start using ArchGuard without complex installation procedures. The configuration points directly to the production Supabase instance, with authentication and project context handled transparently.

Teams access ArchGuard through their existing Claude Code workflows. When they ask architectural questions, they automatically get guidance that starts with sensible defaults and becomes more specific as they add their own rules. This creates a natural adoption path where teams see immediate value and are motivated to customize the system for their specific needs.

## Team Onboarding Process

New teams start with global bootstrap rules that provide general architectural guidance. This ensures they get useful responses immediately, even before they've customized anything. The onboarding process focuses on identifying the architectural decisions the team has already made and codifying those as rules.

The onboarding conversation typically covers authentication patterns, database interaction strategies, API design conventions, testing approaches, and deployment requirements. Instead of creating comprehensive documentation, teams create rules that capture the specific choices they've made. This builds a useful rule set quickly while focusing on decisions that actually matter for daily development work.

Teams don't need to become rule management experts to benefit from ArchGuard. The initial rules they create can be simple and focused on their most important architectural patterns. The system evolves as teams discover which types of guidance are most valuable for their specific development workflows.

## Production Environment Setup

The production Supabase instance includes all the database schema we've developed, with the vector indexes optimized for typical query patterns. The embedding generation uses sentence-transformers running in a cloud environment, ensuring consistent performance regardless of team size or rule complexity.

Authentication flows through Supabase's built-in user management, with project access controlled through the user_project_access table. This means teams can start using the system immediately after signup, with appropriate access controls enforced automatically. The JWT tokens integrate seamlessly with Claude Code's authentication mechanisms.

The MCP server runs as a lightweight service that can be deployed either as a shared service for multiple teams or as team-specific instances for organizations with particular security requirements. The shared service approach reduces operational overhead while the isolated deployment option supports teams with strict compliance requirements.

## Monitoring and Reliability

Production monitoring focuses on both technical performance and user experience metrics. Technical monitoring includes vector search response times, embedding generation latency, database query performance, and API error rates. User experience monitoring tracks guidance relevance, rule usage patterns, and team satisfaction with responses.

The monitoring system alerts on both technical issues and content quality problems. If vector searches start returning irrelevant rules, or if AI synthesis begins generating unhelpful responses, the monitoring system provides early warning so issues can be addressed before they impact user experience.

Reliability requirements are modest initially, since ArchGuard provides advisory guidance rather than critical functionality. The system needs to be available when teams want architectural guidance, but brief outages don't break development workflows. This allows a focus on functionality and user experience rather than complex high-availability infrastructure.

## Data Management and Privacy

Rule data belongs to the teams that create it, and the deployment strategy ensures teams maintain control over their architectural knowledge. The row-level security policies prevent unauthorized access to team-specific rules, while global rules remain available to all users as shared best practices.

Backup and recovery procedures cover both rule content and vector embeddings. Since teams invest time in creating high-quality rules, losing that data would be catastrophic for adoption. The backup strategy ensures teams can recover their complete rule sets even in worst-case scenarios.

Privacy considerations focus on ensuring team-specific architectural knowledge doesn't leak between organizations. The vector embeddings could potentially reveal information about team practices, so the same access controls that protect rule content also protect the embedding data.

## Scaling and Performance Optimization

The initial deployment targets teams of 10-50 developers, which represents the sweet spot for architectural guidance systems. These teams are large enough to benefit from consistent architectural patterns but small enough to make collective decisions about rule content. The infrastructure scales to support larger teams as adoption grows.

Performance optimization focuses on the vector search pathway, since that's the most computationally intensive part of the system. The pgvector indexes are configured for the query patterns we expect, and the embedding generation is optimized for the rule content we're storing. As usage patterns become clear, these optimizations can be refined based on actual data.

The MCP server is designed to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, since teams often ask architectural questions in bursts when starting new features or making major design decisions. The response time target is under 200ms for typical queries, ensuring the guidance feels immediate rather than requiring teams to wait for responses.

## Feedback Collection and Iteration

The deployment strategy includes mechanisms for collecting both quantitative and qualitative feedback about guidance quality. Teams can rate the relevance of responses, suggest improvements to existing rules, and request new rule categories. This feedback drives ongoing improvement of both the technical system and the rule content.

Usage analytics help identify which architectural patterns are most common across teams, which rules provide the most value, and where gaps exist in the current rule coverage. This data informs decisions about which bootstrap rules to add and how to guide teams in creating effective custom rules.

The feedback loop operates quickly, with monthly updates that incorporate user suggestions and address common issues. This rapid iteration ensures the system evolves to meet actual user needs rather than theoretical requirements.

## Integration with Development Workflows

The deployment strategy recognizes that ArchGuard succeeds when it integrates seamlessly with how teams already work. The Claude Code integration means developers get architectural guidance in the context where they're already asking questions. The MCP protocol ensures compatibility with other development tools as the ecosystem evolves.

Teams using other development environments can access ArchGuard through API endpoints or custom integrations. The core guidance logic is independent of the delivery mechanism, so the same rule database can power guidance in different contexts. This flexibility ensures teams can adopt ArchGuard regardless of their specific toolchain preferences.

The integration strategy also considers how ArchGuard fits with existing architectural review processes. Instead of replacing human review, ArchGuard provides consistent guidance that helps teams prepare for architectural discussions and ensures basic patterns are followed before human review begins.

## Success Metrics and Validation

Success is measured primarily by adoption and perceived value rather than technical metrics. The key indicators include daily active teams, frequency of guidance requests, rule creation rates, and qualitative feedback about guidance quality. Technical metrics like response time and search accuracy support these user-focused measures.

The validation approach includes both short-term adoption metrics and longer-term architectural consistency measures. In the short term, teams should be using ArchGuard regularly and finding the guidance helpful. In the longer term, teams should show improved architectural consistency and faster onboarding of new team members.

Regular surveys and interviews with using teams provide qualitative validation that complements the quantitative metrics. These conversations reveal how teams are actually using ArchGuard, what types of guidance are most valuable, and where the system could be improved to better support their development workflows.

## Risk Management and Contingency Planning

The main deployment risks involve guidance quality and user adoption. If teams receive unhelpful or incorrect guidance, they'll stop using the system. The mitigation strategy includes human review of new rules, monitoring of guidance quality, and rapid response to user feedback about problems.

Technical risks are relatively low given the Supabase foundation, but the contingency planning includes backup deployment options and data recovery procedures. The system architecture supports migration to different infrastructure if needed, ensuring teams aren't locked into specific technical choices.

The rollback strategy allows rapid reversion to previous configurations if new deployments introduce problems. Since ArchGuard provides advisory guidance rather than critical functionality, the impact of temporary issues is limited, but quick recovery maintains user confidence in the system reliability.
