# LinkedIn Post: Symmetra Launch

üöÄ **Exciting new MCP project to share** - would love to have your "‚≠ê" on GitHub, and let's community-build this one!

**GitHub**: https://github.com/aic-holdings/symmetra

## **The Problem**
Claude Code and Cursor build beautiful front-ends, but I've found that neither can build complex FAANG-quality systems, often because the LLM experiences context and goal drift.

## **The Solution** 
Symmetra MCP is like having an L7 Google Engineer watching over your code, helping Claude Code make smarter architectural decisions in real-time. Imagine ESLint and Prettier, but for systems engineering.

## **What is Symmetra?**

Symmetra is an extensible AI-powered toolkit that helps development teams define, verify, and maintain their software architecture through real-time guidance and automated analysis.

Unlike traditional linters that focus on syntax, Symmetra provides semantic architectural guidance that understands your codebase's structure, patterns, and design decisions, helping prevent architectural drift before it starts.

---

## **Current Features** ‚úÖ
Your AI coding assistant now has access to:
- `get_guidance()` - Real-time architectural recommendations
- `search_rules()` - Find relevant best practices instantly  
- `list_rule_categories()` - Browse architectural guidance by domain
- `get_symmetra_help()` - Interactive guidance system
- **Semantic search** of architectural rules within Supabase + pgvector
- **Offline AI models** support (gpt-oss-20b, qwen3, etc.)

---

## **Coming Soon** üîÆ
- **Custom best practice rules** by project, user, organization, and tech stack
- **Continuous rule evolution** - rules that learn and adapt
- **Multi-repository governance** - consistent architecture across your entire stack
- **Integration with CI/CD** - architectural validation in your pipeline

---

**Why this matters**: As AI coding becomes mainstream, the bottleneck shifts from "can we write code?" to "can we write *good* code that scales?" Symmetra bridges that gap.

Would love your thoughts, contributions, and that GitHub ‚≠ê!
