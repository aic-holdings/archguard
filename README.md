## üîó Detailed Integration Guide

### Project Setup & Configuration

If you are mostly working with the same project, you can configure to always activate it at startup
by passing `--project <path_or_name>` to the ArchGuard server command in your client's MCP config.
This is especially useful for clients which configure MCP servers on a per-project basis, like Claude Code.

Otherwise, the recommended way is to just ask the LLM to activate a project by providing it an absolute path to, or,
in case the project was configured before, by its name. The default project name is the directory name.

* "Configure ArchGuard for the project /path/to/my_project"
* "Activate ArchGuard for my_project"

All projects that have been configured will be automatically added to your global ArchGuard config, and for each
project, the file `.archguard.toml` will be generated. You can adjust the latter, e.g., by changing the name
(which you refer to during activation) or other architectural rules. Make sure to not have two different projects with
the same name.

‚ÑπÔ∏è For larger projects, we recommend that you analyze your project to accelerate ArchGuard's guidance; otherwise the first
analysis may be slower. To do so, run this from the project directory (or pass the path to the project as an argument):

```shell
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aic-holdings/archguard archguard check
```

### Running the ArchGuard MCP Server

There are several ways to run the ArchGuard MCP server, depending on your setup:

**Option 1: Direct execution with uvx (Recommended)**
```shell
uvx --from git+https://github.com/aic-holdings/archguard archguard server
```

**Option 2: Local development with uv**
```shell
# From ArchGuard source directory
uv run archguard server
```

**Option 3: After installation**
```shell
# If you've installed ArchGuard globally
archguard server
```

**Option 4: Docker**
```shell
docker run --rm -i --network host \
  -v "$(pwd)":/workspace \
  ghcr.io/aic-holdings/archguard:latest \
  archguard server --transport stdio
```

### Claude Code

ArchGuard is a great way to make Claude Code both cheaper and more powerful with architectural guidance!

From your project directory, add ArchGuard with a command like this:

```shell
claude mcp add archguard -- <archguard-mcp-server> --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)
```

where `<archguard-mcp-server>` is your way of [running the ArchGuard MCP server](#running-the-archguard-mcp-server).
For example, when using `uvx`, you would run:

```shell
claude mcp add archguard -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/aic-holdings/archguard archguard server --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è ArchGuard comes with architectural guidance instructions, and Claude needs to read them to properly use ArchGuard's tools.
  As of version `v1.0.52`, Claude Code reads the instructions of the MCP server, so this **is handled automatically**.
  If you are using an older version, or if Claude fails to read the instructions, you can ask it explicitly
  to "read ArchGuard's initial instructions" or access ArchGuard's guidance resources directly.
  Note that you may have to make Claude read the instructions when you start a new conversation and after any compacting operation to ensure Claude remains properly configured to use ArchGuard's tools.

### Other Terminal-Based Clients

There are many terminal-based coding assistants that support MCP servers, such as [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex?tab=readme-ov-file#model-context-protocol-mcp),
[Gemini-CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Qwen3-Coder](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder),
[rovodev](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Rovo-for-Software-Teams-Beta/Introducing-Rovo-Dev-CLI-AI-Powered-Development-in-your-terminal/ba-p/3043623),
the [OpenHands CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/cli-mode) and [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode).

They generally benefit from the architectural guidance tools provided by ArchGuard. You might want to customize some aspects of ArchGuard
by writing your own rules or configuration to adjust it to your workflow, to other MCP servers you are using, and to
the client's internal capabilities.

### Claude Desktop

For [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (available for Windows and macOS), go to File / Settings / Developer / MCP Servers / Edit Config,
which will let you open the JSON file `claude_desktop_config.json`.
Add the `archguard` MCP server configuration, using a [run command](#running-the-archguard-mcp-server) depending on your setup.

* local installation:

   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "archguard": {
               "command": "/abs/path/to/uv",
               "args": ["run", "--directory", "/abs/path/to/archguard", "archguard", "server"]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

* uvx:

   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "archguard": {
               "command": "/abs/path/to/uvx",
               "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/aic-holdings/archguard", "archguard", "server"]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

* docker:

  ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "archguard": {
               "command": "docker",
               "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "--network", "host", "-v", "/path/to/your/projects:/workspaces/projects", "ghcr.io/aic-holdings/archguard:latest", "archguard", "server", "--transport", "stdio"]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

If you are using paths containing backslashes for paths on Windows
(note that you can also just use forward slashes), be sure to escape them correctly (`\\`).

That's it! Save the config and then restart Claude Desktop. You are ready for configuring your first project.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can further customize the run command using additional arguments (see [command-line arguments](#command-line-arguments)).

Note: on Windows and macOS there are official Claude Desktop applications by Anthropic, for Linux there is an [open-source
community version](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian).

‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to fully quit the Claude Desktop application, as closing Claude will just minimize it to the system tray ‚Äì at least on Windows.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some clients may leave behind zombie processes. You will have to find and terminate them manually then.
    With ArchGuard, you can activate the HTTP mode to prevent unnoted processes and also use the HTTP interface
    for monitoring ArchGuard status.

After restarting, you should see ArchGuard's tools in your chat interface (notice the small hammer icon).

For more information on MCP servers with Claude Desktop, see [the official quick start guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user).

### MCP Coding Clients (Cline, Roo-Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

Being an MCP Server, ArchGuard can be included in any MCP Client. The same configuration as above,
perhaps with small client-specific modifications, should work. Most of the popular
existing coding assistants (IDE extensions or VSCode-like IDEs) support connections
to MCP Servers. It is **recommended to use the `ide-assistant` context** for these integrations by adding `"--context", "ide-assistant"` to the `args` in your MCP client's configuration. Including ArchGuard generally boosts their performance
by providing them tools for architectural guidance and code quality analysis.

In this case, the billing for the usage continues to be controlled by the client of your choice
(unlike with the Claude Desktop client). But you may still want to use ArchGuard through such an approach,
e.g., for one of the following reasons:

1. You are already using a coding assistant (say Cline or Cursor) and just want to make it more architecturally aware.
2. You are on Linux and don't want to use the [community-created Claude Desktop](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian).
3. You want tighter integration of ArchGuard into your IDE and don't mind paying for that.

### Command-Line Arguments

The ArchGuard MCP server supports several command-line arguments for customization:

```shell
archguard server [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --project PATH          Project path to activate automatically
  --context CONTEXT       Context mode (ide-assistant, terminal, etc.)
  --transport TRANSPORT   Transport mode (stdio, http)
  --port PORT            HTTP port (when using http transport)
  --log-level LEVEL      Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  --config PATH          Custom configuration file path
  --help                 Show this message and exit
```

**Examples:**
```shell
# Start with specific project
archguard server --project /path/to/my/project

# Start in IDE assistant mode
archguard server --context ide-assistant

# Start HTTP server on custom port
archguard server --transport http --port 8080

# Debug mode with verbose logging
archguard server --log-level DEBUG
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

ArchGuard supports flexible, layered configuration:

### Global Configuration
`~/.config/archguard/config.toml`
```toml
[general]
default_complexity_threshold = "medium"
auto_format_suggestions = true

[rules]
max_file_lines = 300
max_function_lines = 50
enforce_type_hints = true
```

### Project Configuration
`.archguard.toml` (in project root)
```toml
[project]
name = "my-awesome-app"
architecture_style = "clean_architecture"

[rules]
max_file_lines = 500  # Override global setting
custom_patterns = [
    "no_god_objects",
    "single_responsibility"
]

[ignore]
paths = ["migrations/", "legacy/"]
```
